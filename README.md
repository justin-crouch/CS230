## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client, **The Gaming Room**, is a game development studio who developed an Android multiplayer game, *Draw It or Lose It*. The client wanted to redesign this game as a web-based version that can serve a multitude of different platforms, and requested help in creating a software design document to guide the development in this project.

## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

Evaluating different operating systems for their potential of powering the server, as well as analyzing the considerations for each system as the client, was performed particularly well. Each platform contains information about the benefits, detriments, and capabilities of being used as a server. Each platform also lists the considerations for development and deployment methods for the client version.

## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I found working out a plan for execution greatly helped when developing the code. It allowed me to consider all parts of the project, from client requirements to operating system capabilities and limitations, which gave me the insight of how every part of the code interacts with a multtide of clients.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise the recommendations section of this document. For revision, I would add more justification on why each recommendation was selected.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?


## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
