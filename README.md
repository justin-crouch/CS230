## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client, **The Gaming Room**, is a game development studio who developed an Android multiplayer game, *Draw It or Lose It*. The client wanted to redesign this game as a web-based version that can serve a multitude of different platforms, and requested help in creating a software design document to guide the development in this project.

## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

Evaluating different operating systems for their potential of powering the server, as well as analyzing the considerations for each system as the client, was performed particularly well. Each platform contains information about the benefits, detriments, and capabilities of being used as a server. Each platform also lists the considerations for development and deployment methods for the client version.

## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I found working out a plan for execution greatly helped when developing the code. It allowed me to consider all parts of the project, from client requirements to operating system capabilities and limitations, which gave me the insight of how every part of the code interacts with a multitude of clients.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise the recommendations section of this document. For revision, I would add more justification on why each recommendation was selected.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's needs by comparing what the client wanted to how it benefits the user. In some cases, a client's want either had no actual benefit for the user, or decreased value for a subset of users. Through this comparison, the user's needs were directly integrated, or at least considered, into the design document. It is important to consider the user's needs since any project is about benefiting the user. If a project is designed without the user in mind, then the end product could be ultimately useless for the user.

## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached designing software by understanding what the client wants, who the ideal user is, and the limitations of potential solutions of the project. Since I do not know every technology capability, nor ways in how every project can be developed, a great amount of research had to be conducted. I would certainly use this strategy of understanding the client, user, and technology limitations for designing software in the future.
